# Project name: Super-Store-Average Sales and Profit Report
-----
# Project Objective: To analyse the average sales and profit between 2014 to 2017.
-----
# Data Source: Data was provided by the facilitator, Mr Ahmed Oyelowo via www.udemy.com
----
# Data Transformation: The data was downloaded as an MS-Excel file. It was then imported into Power BI Desktop. Via Power Query, the customer ID column was removed, the table headers were promoted and column integrity was verified. The Close & Apply tab was clicked to move the data table to yhe Report page. Visuals were created using the Line Chart for the Average Sales & Average Profit by Month and Year. The Average Sales and Profit by Ship mode was visualized using the Donut Chart. Top N Filtering was applied to four slicers displaying the Top and Bottom 5 Products by Average Sales & Profit. Three additional slicers were used to filter the Month, Categories and Segments of Product, Sales, and Profit. A Text box was inserted to type in the Title of the Report. Then a Back Button was inserted to link both pages of the report. Finally, the theme was formatted to make the visual appealing, readable and convey information quickly. The report was then published to Power BI Service.

# Findings: Four types of envelopes were among the bottom 5 products. It could be that there is low demand for these products. Average sales dips in is above the benchmark sales between Febraury and March, as well as September and December across the four years. 
------
# Recommendations: A survey of product functionality, quality, demand, ease of use, customer service and durability should be carried out among the consumers find out why the bottom 5 products have low patronage. Where the low sales is as a reult of low or no demand, it is advisable to channel resources towards the products with high demand to generate more profit. The result of the survey will determine the next course of action to address the poor sales of these products. Incentives should be attached as rewards to the purchase of the Top 5 products to maintain and improve their sales also. The Marketing team should be collaborated with to find out why there is a dip in Sales in January and between April to September. This will enable the organisation to prepare means to mitigate future dip in sales and profit during these months.
